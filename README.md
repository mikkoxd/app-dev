## **Plot Overview** {#plot}
**Interstellar** is a visually stunning and emotionally charged science fiction film set in a dystopian future. Earth is slowly becoming uninhabitable due to environmental disasters, and humanity's survival hinges on finding a new planet to colonize.

A team of astronauts, led by former pilot **Cooper** (Matthew McConaughey), embarks on a journey through a wormhole near Saturn to explore potential planets in another galaxy. Their mission is to secure a new home for mankind. As they venture into the unknown, the boundaries of space and time are pushed to their limits, with mind-bending twists and turns that question the nature of love, time, and the universe itself.

### **Definition List**

- **Wormhole**: A theoretical passage through space-time allowing shortcuts between distant regions of space.
- **Time Dilation**: A concept from Einstein’s theory of relativity, where time passes slower for objects moving at speeds close to the speed of light or in strong gravitational fields.
- **Black Hole**: A region in space where gravity is so strong that not even light can escape.
